# Project-Euler-First-100

Explanation of and solutions (in Python) for some of the first 100 Project Euler problems.  The hope is to make it through all 100 eventually!

Complete information on the wonderful and always-growing Project Euler can be found at https://projecteuler.net/about.

Project Euler generally discourages sharing solutions - the point is to experience the reward of solving each problem yourself! - but makes an exception for the first 100 problems.  From the above link:

>...the rule about sharing solutions outside of Project Euler does not apply to the first one-hundred problems, as long as any discussion clearly aims to instruct methods, not just provide answers, and does not directly threaten to undermine the enjoyment of solving later problems.

So, for each problem documented here, I aim not just to share the code I used for the solution, but to explain _why_ I used the code that I did.  **I strongly recommend that you solve each problem yourself, or at least try to**! But if you're stuck, or if you've solved it but just want to compare notes on how you did it, I hope that you find what I've written here helpful.

## A bit about me

I am an amateur mathematics enthusiast and self-taught Python afficionado.  In short, I am *far* from an expert in either mathematics or coding.  But I do love using code to solve challenging problems.  Project Euler was my gateway into coding, in a way; someone told me about it in 2016 and I've been hooked on coding ever since.  I hope that the little forays into the world of Project Euler that I post here help communicate my enthusiasm and inspire it in others.

## A bit about this project and how you can use it

My discussion of each problem I've completed can be found in the problems folder.  Each one is a Jupyter notebook - a platform that lets you write text and run code in the same environment.  Specifically I've used Google Colab; if you click the "Open in Colab" link at the top of each solution, you can read what I've written *and* run the Python code I've used for yourself.

I assume a little bit of Python knowledge, the kind you can get in an introductory Python tutorial course online, but not much more than that.  And when I can I try to provide links to documentation or external resources I find helpful in explaining Python features.
