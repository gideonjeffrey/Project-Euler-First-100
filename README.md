# Project-Euler-First-100
Explanation of and solutions (in Python) for some of the first 100 Project Euler problems.  The hope is to make it through all 100 eventually!

Complete information on the wonderful and always-growing Project Euler can be found at https://projecteuler.net/about.

Project Euler generally discourages sharing solutions - the point is to experience the reward of solving each problem yourself! - but makes an exception for the first 100 problems.  From the above link:

>the rule about sharing solutions outside of Project Euler does not apply to the first one-hundred problems, as long as any discussion clearly aims to instruct methods, not just provide answers, and does not directly threaten to undermine the enjoyment of solving later problems.

So, for each problem documented here, I am not just to share the code I used for the solution, but to explain _why_ I used the code that I did.
